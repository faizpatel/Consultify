    <p class = "ab">Hey there, I'm Faiz Patel, the brain behind this site. I created this space because I was on the hunt for something specific – a way to ace consulting interviews, especially when it comes to those tricky mathematical drills. Strangely, I couldn't find what I needed online, so I thought, why not hack together my own solution?</p>
    <p class = "ab">So, welcome to my brainchild, a place where I'm figuring out how to master those mental gymnastics and quickfire solutions. No fancy bells and whistles, just a genuine attempt to make studying for consulting interviews a bit less daunting.</p>
    <p class = "ab">As I go along, my plan is to keep tweaking and improving this site. It's a work in progress, just like the interview preparation journey itself. I want this to be a spot that grows with you, adding features and insights that genuinely help.</p>
    <p class = "ab">Stick around, join me in this experiment, and let's make studying for consulting interviews a tad less painful – and maybe even a bit fun. Here's to hacking our way to success together! Cheers, Faiz.</p>
